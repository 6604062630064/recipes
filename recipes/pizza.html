        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="italic">
                <li>Yeast</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Bread Flour</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape. Cold dough is much more difficult to work with.

                </li>
                <li>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</li>
                <li>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</li>
                <li>This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature before using.</li>
                <li>Yes! You can absolutely freeze pizza dough. This is a great option for people who make pizza often. Prepare the dough for freezing by rolling it into a ball and lightly coating it with oil. Place the ball in a freezer-safe container labeled with the date. Freeze for about three months.

                    To thaw the dough, simply transfer it to the fridge the night before you plan to use it.</li>
